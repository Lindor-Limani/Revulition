### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**Revulition/Revulition** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my school carrier and some private projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the concepts of DP (dynamic programming) and machine learning
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything regarding to Java or C#, if it is within my abilities I am willing to help you ;)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Lindor.Limani@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to play Basketball and in general sports. :)
